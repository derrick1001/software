# This documentation defines the use of the radio automation program

# Your Mikrotik now has functionality to reprogram itself to work as a local network for programming 800 series Cambium radios

# To enable this mode, press the mode/reset button on the side of your Mikrotik, and wait a few seconds. You should see a red light come on

# If this light is on, remote access is disabled. If at any time you need to revert back, just press the mode/reset button again, red light should go away

# Connect to the wifi network you want before you get started. The Mikrotik ssid is "DBOX", and once you are connected to it, move on to the next step

# Start the iSH app on your phone, you should see your phones name in the terminal window.

# From here, just type the word go, and the program will start.

# Follow the menu instructions on what actions you want to take, you only have to type the number of the option you want.

# It doesnt matter what order you do the radios in, HI/LO or LO/HI, just select the appropriate option for the radio you are connected to

# Check radio connectivity EVERY time before you start any option, this will mitigate errors in program.

# If radio connectivity isnt working, and you have verified connections, close the app, reconnect to the wifi network, start the app and try again.
